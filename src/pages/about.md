I am a French cybersecurity student who intends to help develop open source projects by leveraging my cybersecurity skills.

Open source projects provide trust for the user and shift the focus towards true improvement rather than keeping things secret to limit competition.

Another really important point of open source projects is privacy, there are a lot of proofs across history that shows how much a software can collect data. Having something that is not hiding any creepy piece of code inside it makes me happier.
